# Live Site - http://mobile-resell-wizards.web.app

Welcome to our website where you can buy and sell used phones with confidence.

As a buyer, you can browse through a wide selection of used phones and book a meet with the seller to see the phone in person before making a purchase. You also have the option to report any suspicious listings.

As a seller, you can advertise your used phones for sale and communicate with interested buyers through our platform. You also have the ability to report any suspicious listings. To ensure the authenticity of the phones being sold on our website, we have implemented a seller verification process. This means that all verified sellers have undergone a thorough background check and have been approved by our team. Every verified seller's listing has a tick besides the seller's name. 

As an Admin you can delete any buyer, seller, or reported phones as necessary and verify any seller to ensure the safety and security of our users.
